# fractais
Welcome to my first **fractal** project. I really like math and this project show me how do work with complex numbers.\
My first challenge and question was **"what is a complex number?"** and I found that a complex number is a sum of a real number and a imaginary number\
after that, i focussed my searchers at **What is a imaginary number?** and found that **IÂ²=-1** and that got me confused rsrs.\
# Understanding complex numbers
The key to understand a complex number and how its work is imagine a cartesian plan, a complex number is  a sum of a real part number and a imaginary part number\
>**C = a +bi**\
>**a** = Real number\
>**bi** = Imaginary number\
imaginary number you can just imagine them. just take care when you need to make operations\
I think the first thing we need to understand is what is a number lines\
>**in Maths, number lines are the horizontal straight lines in which the integers are placed in equal intervals. All the numbers in a sequence can be represented in a number line. This line extends indefinitely at both ends.**
